        <h1>Top 3 Sports Bikes 2021</h1>
        <p><strong>If you want to get from A to B as quickly
            as possible on the road then a sports bike is probably for you.</strong><br><br>

            To achieve this they sacrifice comfort for an aerodynamic advantage
            and maximum lean angles, make use of the latest technology<br>
            and tend to be quite expensive. <a href="#article" class="button">What is a sports bike?</a>

                            No sports bike top ten would be complete without a beautiful Ducati, in this case the new<br>

                        </p>
                        <p>   It sets the bar high on looks, power, weight and features all the tech you would expect.</p>
                        <p>
                            There's Ohlins electrically adjustable suspension, cornering ABS, slide control, a lean angle <br>

                    <h2>WHAT IS A SPORTS BIKE?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sports bikes have one goal in mind, which is going as fast as possible from A to B.<br>
                        They achieve this by minimising weight while at the same time maximising power<br>
                        (ideally around 1 bhp per 1 kg of weight), a low aggressive riding position, <br>
                        full aerodynamic fairing, state of the art technology and the best lean angle <br>
                        possible for cornering as low as possible. The most expensive bikes are usually closely<br>
                        related to the manufacturer's MotoGP race bike of the time.
