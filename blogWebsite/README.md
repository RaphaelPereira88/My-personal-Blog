## Landing Page porject: ##

The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

Requires javascript HTML and CSS knowledges.

##What You Will Build:##
You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.
