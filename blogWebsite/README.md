## Landing Page project: ##

The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.


## my project description: ##
- website/Blog dedicated to one of my hobbies : motorbikes
1. the first navigation bar gives you access to :
  * the home page or if you are at the bottom of the page by clicking on it it will bring you back to the top page
  * a news website
  * a form to sign up 

2.the second navigation bar will help you go through each sections of the home page. 
  * By clicking on each section of the nav bar, you will get the home page scrolling down smoothly up to the section selected.
  * you will have a green color on the section selected on the nav bar . THis green color will switch by itself according to the section you will scroll to (works as a bookmark)

3. In the Bikes sections you can click on the pictures and links to be redirected others page like racebike.html,nakedbike.html, etc...

## What You Will Build: ##
You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.
